TO DO APP
=====================

This is a simple to do app that i made  to practise in state management with react.
I used the context and the useReducer hook to manage the state of the app.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
